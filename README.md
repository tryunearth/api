### Like Pocket for Reddit saves.

</div>

This repository contains the code for the backend server which exposes the
Unearth RESTful API. [[WIP] Documentation](https://www.notion.so/Unearth-API-Documentation-96d4cc3345584932823ddcc1a8f0d411)

## What Is Unearth?

### Background

Reddit is a goldmine of informationâ€”with posts and comments ranging in emotion
from funny and lighthearted, to straight-to-the-point and motivational, to
everything in-between and beyond. It's not uncommon for Redditors to save these
things, finding value in them and wishing to have a reference to it later on.

But saving things leads to a couple of problems. For starters, the number of
saves allowed on Reddit is limited and there is the chance of previous saves
being overwritten when that limit is reached. The other issue is many Redditors
save things but forget to ever go back and view said things. [Read more about why
Reddit's save functionality is subpar](https://cedric.tech/blog/reddits-save-functionality-sucks/).

### Vision

The current tools provided by Reddit are insufficient at helping Redditors
manage and rediscover their saved things.

**Unearth 2.0 aims to be the best platform to help Redditors manage their
saved content and regain control of their saved data.** In version 1.0, we
wanted to help Redditors rediscover the things they have saved through the use
of frequent reminders via email.

That service has [proven to be helpful for many](https://cedric.tech/blog/unearth-diary-04-does-it-even-work/)
but doesn't check as many of the boxes as we'd like. So, after further analysis
of the complaints Redditors had with saving things, we designed an app capable
of solving many of those other issues, namely: categorizing saves into folders
or with tags, filtering, searching, and sorting saves.

### Status

Unearth 2.0 is currently still in development.

Unearth 1.0 (Reddit saves surfacing service) however is completed.
[Feel free to try it today](https://www.tryunearth.com).
